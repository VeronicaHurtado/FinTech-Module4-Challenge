# FinTech-Module4-Challenge

The aim of this tool is to evaluate a number of portfolios and select the portfolio that is performing the best across 
multiple areas: volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios.

The code is presented via a Jupyter Lab notebook that analyses the major metrics of the portfolios based on historical 
daily returns.

The data provided for comparison includes: some algorithmic portfolios from a simulated firm/company `algo_returns.csv`, 
a representation of the portfolios of famous "whale" investors like Warren Buffett `whale_returns.csv`, and some from the 
big hedge and mutual funds. 

Based on this analysis a custom portfolio of stocks will be created and compared to the others, as well as the larger 
market (S&P TSX 60 Index).
